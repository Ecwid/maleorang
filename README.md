### General info
MaleOrang provides access to [MailChimp API v3.0](http://developer.mailchimp.com/documentation/mailchimp/reference/overview/) methods from Java code. It is a continuation of [ecwid-mailchimp](https://github.com/Ecwid/maleorang) which is no longer supported.

MaleOrang is written in [Kotlin language](https://kotlinlang.org/) and can be used with any language which runs on JVM. Refer to the [javadoc pages](http://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.raisin/maleorang/) for details.

### Supported MailChimp API methods

Currently MaleOrang has wrappers for a number of MailChimp API methods:
* [Members methods](http://developer.mailchimp.com/documentation/mailchimp/reference/lists/members/)
* [List methods](https://developer.mailchimp.com/documentation/mailchimp/reference/lists/)
* [Campaign methods](https://developer.mailchimp.com/documentation/mailchimp/reference/campaigns/)
* [Reports methods](https://developer.mailchimp.com/documentation/mailchimp/reference/reports/)
* [Batch Operations methods](http://developer.mailchimp.com/documentation/mailchimp/reference/batches/)

However, it is easy to extend the API and add support for any method you need (see the samples below).
